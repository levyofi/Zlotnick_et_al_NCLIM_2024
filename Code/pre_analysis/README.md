Here are the codes used to produce the data used for Figure S6 (activity patterns in the past and future along the year, across various climates).

The input for these scripts can be derived by a special run of the lizard model (un-comment the "## additional information - about climbing" section in the "Summary" module and run the model).

To produce the source data for Figure S6:
1. run the "1 unite all_all_files.py" script
2. run the "2 summing_np.py" script
